# employee-tracker-app

This application was created with the purpose of facilitating the access to an organization's database so that vital and sensitive information such as department, roles, employees, salaries, etc. can be displayed in an accurate way.

# Description:
In order to access the organization's database it is necessary to log into MySQL with the commands "mysql -u root -p" and then enter the database password. Once the user has worked on the data structure files ("schema.sql" and "seeds.sql"), it is ready to run the employee tracker application. To do so, the user will have to type the command "quit;" to exit MySQL database and then enter the commands "node index.js". Then, a menu of options is displayed to execute different actions, such as view all departments, roles, and employees; add a department, a role and an employee; and update an employee.

# Usage:
With this application, the user will be able to access the organization's database in an efficient manner and perform different actions rapidly.

# Technologies:
The technologies used to build this application are MySQL, JavaScript, Node.js and the packages mysql2, console.table and inquirer.
